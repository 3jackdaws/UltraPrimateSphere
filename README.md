<p>Ultra Primate Sphere is the working name for a physics based marble roller ball game created in Unity.  The goal of the game is to get the starting marble player object to the end of the level.  

<h2>Game Engine</h2>

<p>I've never used Unity before, so all its features as well as its user interface is new to me.  However, I can appreciate its ease of use.</p>

<h2>Level Design</h2>
Levels feature floating platforms that must be traversed to reach the end.

Players must control marble rotational velocity and speed when landing.
