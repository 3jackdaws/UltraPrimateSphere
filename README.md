###Game Engine


![](http://isogen.net/img/unity_logo.png)

<p>I've never used Unity before, so all its features as well as its user interface is new to me.  However, I can appreciate its ease of use.  All scripting is done is C#.</p>

###Level Design
Levels feature floating platforms that must be traversed to reach the end, marked by a special platform.  Later levels feature moving platforms or obstacles that may knock the player off the map.  Players can use power-ups that are scattered throughout the levels to aid in their playthrough.  Some levels may require the use of a powerup, or may even require the use of multiple powerups in quick succession.

###Physics
The game is entirely physics based.  The marble does not have a forced applied to it.  By moving forward, the marble has a torque applied to it.



Players must control marble rotational velocity and speed when landing.
